# Derivatives-Pricing-Models

Repository of codes related to derivatives pricing:

1. <strong> binomial-pricing-eu-am</strong>: code to calculate the price of an European or American Put or Call option using the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model. The code has a separate function to calculate the stock price lattice which would be reused later.

2. <strong> bsm-model </strong> : code to calculate the price of an European option using the Black-Scholes-Merton model. The code uses the analytic formula and Monte Carlo simulations using the concept of Martingale pricing.

3. <strong> zcb-term-structure </strong>: code to calculate and plot the term structure of interest rates from Zero Coupon Bond prices by simulating the evolution of the short rate lattice using a binomial tree.

4. <strong> swap-price </strong> : code to calculate the price of an interest rate swap using martingale pricing in a binomial tree.

5. 4. <strong> swaption-price </strong> : code to calculate the price of a swaption (option on a swap) using martingale pricing in a binomial tree.
